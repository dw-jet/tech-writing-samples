# API Samples

The following samples are API documentation.

1. I'm not able to share reference documentation from work, so I'm including some reference documentation from a [hobby project](./api-reference.md).
2. The [quick start guide](./api-overview.md) is a sample of the documentation from a system I developed for my employer. It is used with permission.
3. 

All samples are written in markdown and built for the web with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
