# FAQ - Open Source BI System

## Where does the data come from?

The data comes from the same internal databases it always has. This application organizes everything in one place.

## Do I have to make my own reports?

No, you don't. We encourage you to try, but if you need assistance, contact Information Systems at extension 1234. We are always happy to help.

## Doesn't open source mean lower quality?

No, it doesn't. The open source tools we use are developed and reviewed by dozens of talented engineers. With all those eyes on the code, it's rare to have a severe problem.

## How do I get access to more information?

If you think you should have access to something you don't, get ahold of IS at extension 1234. We will speak with management about your concerns and get back to you.
