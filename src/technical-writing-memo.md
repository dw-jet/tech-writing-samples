# Purpose Statement

This memo aims to give better explanation of how to access the knowledge base that went live last week.

I would like to start by apologizing for any confusion caused by the last set of instructions you received. There were a few missing pieces that made them difficult to follow. Please disregard those instructions and follow along below.

# New Instructions

The knowledge base is part of our existing Spiceworks ticketing system. To see our internal knowledgebase articles:

1.  Log in to Spiceworks at <https://on.spiceworks.com> using your existing username and password.

2.  Click on the *Knowledge Base* link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

3.  Switch from the *Everyone* tab to the *My Team* tab. The tabs are under the *Knowledge Base* heading at the top of the page.

4.  Type in a search term to find relevant articles.

# Technical Support

If you still have trouble accessing the knowledge base feel free to contact James Teitsworth at 1122.

If you have an idea for a knowledge base article, get in touch with Michael Smith at extension 1111.

Thank you for your understanding.
