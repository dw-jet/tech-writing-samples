# Tutorials

The following samples are from documentation that I've written in the last year.

1. The [Scoop Quickstart](scoop-quick-start-guide.md) was written as part of my portfolio for the Technical Writer HQ Certification.
2. [Gradient Border in Webflow](gradient-border.md) is a tutorial I wrote in the style of Webflow's documentation.
3. [Remove Pocket from Firefox](Tutorial.md) was a document I put together for the IT department at work. It is used with permission. 
4. [Memo](./technical-writing-memo.md) is my final project from a technical writing class at Oregon State University.

All samples are written in markdown and built for the web with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
